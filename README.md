This project is about Hanoi-Towers.
There are 4 pegs with the numbers(0 to 3) and n white disks and also n black disks.
The white disks are in peg number 0 and the black disks are in peg number 2.
The place of the white disks and black disks should be change just with using of pegs number 1 and 3, and this process should be done with hanoi algoritms.
The maximum numbers of disks is 8.
